# EgotGames — Marketing Copy (Platform Overview + Landing Page Sections)

This document is a marketing-focused content draft based on the current EgotGames product surface in this repo (game creation, editor, AI assistant, publishing/sharing, assets, community explore, friends/chat, screenshots, credits).

## One-liner (pick one)

1. **EgotGames is an AI-assisted 2D game creation platform—build with blocks or code, preview instantly, and share playable games in minutes.**
2. **Turn an idea into a playable browser game with AI, Blockly, and p5.js—then publish and share it with a link.**
3. **A fast, friendly way to create, iterate, and publish 2D games—powered by AI and built for the web.**

## Short product paragraph

EgotGames helps you create playable 2D browser games faster—from a simple prompt to a running prototype. Start in beginner-friendly **Blockly blocks** or jump straight into a full **p5.js JavaScript** code editor, then iterate with an in-editor **AI assistant**. Save progress to the cloud, generate pixel-art assets, capture screenshots, and publish your game as **public or private**—all shareable with a single link.

## Landing page content (after the hero)

### “Why EgotGames” section

**Build real games, not demos.** EgotGames gives you the tools to go from idea → playable loop → shareable link with a workflow designed for fast iteration.

- **Two creation modes:** Visual blocks (Blockly) for beginners, or p5.js JavaScript for advanced creators.
- **AI that edits your project:** Ask for changes in plain language; the assistant updates your blocks/code while keeping existing features.
- **Instant preview:** Play your game as you build, with a browser-ready runtime.
- **Publish + share:** Toggle between draft/published and private/public—then share with friends or the community.
- **Assets & pixel art:** Upload sprites/sounds, or generate pixel art with AI and save it to your library.
- **Premium membership ($5/mo):** Download your games, unlock 3D creation with three.js, and get **50 free AI credits every month**.

### “How it works” (3 steps)

1. **Describe your game**  
   Choose Blockly or JavaScript, tell EgotGames what you want to build, and get a clean starting point.
2. **Create + iterate fast**  
   Use the editor with AI assistance to add mechanics, tune difficulty, refine visuals, and keep the game loop tight.
3. **Publish and share**  
   Make it public, keep it private, or share with specific users—then send a link anyone can play in the browser.
